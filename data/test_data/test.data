109705 | 0.27778 | The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
109712 | 0.47222 | The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .

109783 | 0.22222 | The film can depress you about life itself .
109790 | 0.11111 | The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
109793 | 0.41667 | The film has a childlike quality about it .
109816 | 0.22222 | The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
109821 | 0.41667 | The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
109842 | 0.25 | The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
109843 | 0.41667 | The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .
109846 | 0.33333 | The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...

109859 | 0.29167 | The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .

109891 | 0.5 | The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .
109901 | 0.45833 | The inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
109904 | 0.22222 | The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
109910 | 0.48611 | The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .
109918 | 0.16667 | The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .

109945 | 0.27778 | The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
109948 | 0.34722 | The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
109951 | 0.47222 | The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
109954 | 0.125 | The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
109978 | 0.18056 | The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
109981 | 0.31944 | The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
109986 | 0.34722 | The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
109987 | 0.47222 | The movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .
109992 | 0.25 | The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
109993 | 0.34722 | The movie is a mess from start to finish .
109994 | 0.27778 | The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .
110004 | 0.375 | The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
110006 | 0.083333 | The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
110008 | 0.23611 | The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .
110009 | 0.30556 | The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true .
110011 | 0.29167 | The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
110016 | 0.47222 | The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .
110027 | 0.27778 | The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .
110032 | 0.38889 | The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
110042 | 0.083333 | The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
110045 | 0.38889 | The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
110050 | 0.375 | The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
110053 | 0.30556 | The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
110055 | 0.15278 | The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .

110065 | 0.25 | The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
110067 | 0.44444 | The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .
110080 | 0.41667 | The philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film 's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable .
110090 | 0.20833 | The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
110091 | 0.44444 | The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .
110097 | 0.43056 | The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
110099 | 0.25 | The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
110100 | 0.18056 | The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
110103 | 0.097222 | The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
110117 | 0.26389 | The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
110127 | 0.5 | The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
110134 | 0.18056 | The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
110136 | 0.5 | The result might look like Vulgar .
110137 | 0.31944 | The results are far more alienating than involving .
110144 | 0.41667 | The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .
110145 | 0.33333 | The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
110148 | 0.26389 | The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
110149 | 0.125 | The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
110152 | 0.375 | The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
110155 | 0.34722 | The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
110164 | 0.33333 | The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
110172 | 0.31944 | The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .
110175 | 0.47222 | The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .
110180 | 0.47222 | The story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there 's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .

110217 | 0.20833 | The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
110220 | 0.29167 | The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
110243 | 0.43056 | The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
110248 | 0.083333 | The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
110251 | 0.27778 | The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
110253 | 0.45833 | The whole affair is as predictable as can be .

110278 | 0.22222 | There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments .
110286 | 0.41667 | There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
110292 | 0.38889 | There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
110299 | 0.29167 | There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
110300 | 0.33333 | There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
110311 | 0.43056 | There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
110312 | 0.33333 | There 's no good answer to that one .
110313 | 0.34722 | There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
110318 | 0.33333 | There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .

110325 | 0.20833 | There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
110326 | 0.11111 | There 's nothing to gain from watching They .
110336 | 0.22222 | There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
110337 | 0.27778 | There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .
110344 | 0.29167 | There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
110356 | 0.33333 | There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .

110445 | 0.13889 | This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
110455 | 0.5 | This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .

18996 | 0.81944 | It 's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .

19000 | 0.69444 | It 's still worth a look .
19002 | 0.875 | It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .

19293 | 0.69444 | The Transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
19303 | 0.81944 | The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
19306 | 0.69444 | The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
19309 | 0.81944 | The film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
19311 | 0.86111 | The film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .

19339 | 0.61111 | The tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .
19342 | 0.66667 | The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .

19347 | 0.77778 | The whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like Bellini and Mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .

25648 | 0.58333 | If The Count of Monte Cristo does n't transform Caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago .
25652 | 0.86111 | If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life 's urgent questions .
25655 | 0.72917 | If it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
25659 | 0.55556 | If the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .
25663 | 0.70833 | If you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone .
25665 | 0.84722 | If you love Motown music , you 'll love this documentary .
25667 | 0.75 | If your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it .

25675 | 0.65278 | In Adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
25677 | 0.80556 | In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .
25679 | 0.875 | In his debut as a film director , Denzel Washington delivers a lean and engaging work .
25681 | 0.55556 | In spite of Good Housekeeping 's unsavory characters and WWF mentality , this white trash War of the Roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
25689 | 0.75 | Inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
25695 | 0.72222 | Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .
25699 | 0.70833 | Interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , Hopkins and Norton are a winning combination -- but Fiennes steals ` Red Dragon ' right from under their noses .
25701 | 1 | Invincible is a wonderful movie .
25710 | 0.58333 | Is it a total success ?
25716 | 0.76042 | Is n't quite the equal of Woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest American film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his Hong Kong films .
25720 | 0.51389 | It 's a Count for our times .
25721 | 0.80556 | It 's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown Chelsea Hotel ...
25722 | 0.61111 | It 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
25723 | 0.81944 | It 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
25727 | 0.54167 | It 's a coming-of-age story we 've all seen bits of in other films -- but it 's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .
25728 | 0.875 | It 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .
25729 | 0.80556 | It 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .
25730 | 0.79167 | It 's a lovely film with lovely performances by Buy and Accorsi .
25732 | 0.75 | It 's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and Gibson , stepping in for Bruce Willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
25733 | 0.73611 | It 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .
25734 | 0.80556 | It 's a pleasure to see Seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies Chris Rock , Garry Shandling and Colin Quinn .
25735 | 0.77778 | It 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most American representations of Castro .
25736 | 0.83333 | It 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
25737 | 0.76389 | It 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
25738 | 0.77778 | It 's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice .
25739 | 0.81944 | It 's also , clearly , great fun .
25741 | 0.70833 | It 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous Full Frontal .
25742 | 0.81944 | It 's as close as we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works .
25743 | 0.76389 | It 's astonishing .
25744 | 0.68056 | It 's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ...

25754 | 0.68056 | It 's like a poem .
25759 | 0.86111 | It 's one of the most honest films ever made about Hollywood .
25761 | 0.77778 | It 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .
25762 | 0.79167 | It 's rather like a Lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .
25763 | 0.84722 | It 's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that does n't feel it has to prove anything .
25766 | 0.69444 | It 's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it 's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep .
25767 | 0.72222 | It 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that Hollywood too rarely provides .
25771 | 0.69444 | It 's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children .
25773 | 0.76389 | It all adds up to good fun .
25775 | 0.76389 | It dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile .
25776 | 0.76389 | It deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .
25779 | 0.94444 | It further declares its director , Zhang Yang of Shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .
25780 | 0.56944 | It has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it 's over .
25781 | 0.79167 | It has fun being grown up .
25782 | 0.77778 | It has the charm of the original American road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker 's motherland .
25783 | 0.84722 | It has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion .
25785 | 0.68056 | It helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well .
25787 | 0.61111 | It is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .
25790 | 0.70833 | It is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of Stewart and Hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle .
25791 | 0.88889 | It is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
25792 | 0.65278 | It is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
25794 | 0.72222 | It is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .
25795 | 0.93056 | It is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .
25796 | 0.73611 | It is so refreshing to see Robin Williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years .
25797 | 0.63889 | It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it does n't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the Cold War datedness -- of its premise .
25798 | 0.81944 | It never fails to engage us .
25799 | 0.73611 | It provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .
25800 | 0.90278 | It provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
25802 | 0.61111 | It suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like Hatfield and Hicks .
25803 | 0.66667 | It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .
25805 | 0.83333 | It turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .
25812 | 0.63889 | Its direction , its script , and Weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for .
25829 | 0.72222 | Jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
25842 | 0.68056 | Japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .
25851 | 0.68056 | Jason X has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .

25901 | 0.73611 | Kinnear does n't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth .
25920 | 0.79167 | LaPaglia 's ability to convey grief and hope works with Weaver 's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .
25927 | 0.83333 | Lathan and Diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
25931 | 0.83333 | Lauren Ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
25936 | 0.91667 | Leave it to Rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .

25979 | 0.625 | Like Leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable .
25980 | 0.90278 | Like Mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for Lil Bow Wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .
25986 | 0.72222 | Like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
26003 | 0.73611 | Look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
26026 | 0.75 | Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter\/Spider-Man .
26030 | 0.65278 | Majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .
26031 | 0.76389 | Majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
26035 | 0.84722 | Makes S&M seem very romantic , and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight .
26036 | 0.61111 | Makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man 's greatness .
26037 | 0.56944 | Makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun .
26041 | 0.93056 | Manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .
26042 | 0.86111 | Manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer .
26053 | 0.79167 | Marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .
26061 | 0.83333 | Maud and Roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .
26063 | 0.72222 | May be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
26075 | 0.76042 | Merchant effectively translates Naipaul 's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .
26090 | 0.90278 | Mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun .
26099 | 0.84722 | Montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
26106 | 0.66667 | More honest about Alzheimer 's disease , I think , than Iris .
26108 | 0.66667 | More than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .
26125 | 0.84722 | Much monkeyfun for all .
26139 | 0.83333 | My oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
26171 | 0.72222 | Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
26176 | 0.65278 | Nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood .
26190 | 0.88889 | Nicolas Philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern France in his documentary To Be and to Have , easily one of the best films of the year .
26194 | 0.83333 | Nine Queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .
26203 | 0.90278 | No sophomore slump for director Sam Mendes , who segues from Oscar winner to Oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
26208 | 0.75 | Nolan bravely treads where few American films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ...
26210 | 0.73611 | Not a bad journey at all .
26213 | 0.72222 | Not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .
26222 | 0.76389 | Not everything works , but the average is higher than in Mary and most other recent comedies .
26225 | 0.61111 | Not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .
26229 | 0.81944 | Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
26235 | 0.77778 | Not too far below the gloss you can still feel director Denis Villeneuve 's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .
26237 | 0.69444 | Nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .
26246 | 0.84722 | Novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .
26250 | 0.61111 | Noyce 's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
26252 | 0.52778 | Noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .
26256 | 0.75 | Occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new .
26257 | 0.55556 | Occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
26259 | 0.77778 | Occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for Zhao .
26265 | 0.875 | Offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude .
26270 | 0.90278 | Often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , Hell House is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed .
26272 | 0.56944 | Often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the American ` hosts ' and their ` guests . '
26275 | 0.88889 | Old-form moviemaking at its best .
26280 | 0.83333 | On its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist Byatt .
26282 | 0.875 | On this tricky topic , Tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .
26285 | 0.75 | Once again , director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale .
26287 | 0.63889 | Once you get into its rhythm ... the movie becomes a heady experience .
26292 | 0.66667 | One of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others .
26294 | 0.84722 | One of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you 're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you did n't know was being taken .
26296 | 0.91667 | One of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals ... a psychological masterpiece .
26298 | 0.75 | One of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .
26299 | 0.97222 | One of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year .

26302 | 0.78125 | One scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce .
26306 | 0.94444 | Only an epic documentary could get it all down , and Spike Lee 's Jim Brown : All American at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .
26323 | 0.83333 | Pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived Dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .
26344 | 0.875 | People cinema at its finest .
26383 | 0.77778 | Pray 's film works well and will appeal even to those who are n't too familiar with turntablism .
26385 | 0.77778 | Pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura .
26407 | 0.70833 | Quite funny for the type of movie it is ...
26410 | 0.86111 | Rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .
26419 | 0.91667 | Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
26421 | 0.75 | Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .
26423 | 0.91667 | Rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as Monsoon Wedding .

26437 | 0.79167 | Reggio 's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
26442 | 0.72222 | Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
26444 | 0.69444 | Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty .
26447 | 0.65278 | Reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .
26448 | 0.70833 | Reinforces the talents of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman , creator of Adaptation and Being John Malkovich .
26457 | 0.83333 | Resourceful and ingenious entertainment .
26465 | 0.88889 | Rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , Les Destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
26500 | 0.58333 | Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .
26507 | 0.69444 | Sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero .

26594 | 0.63889 | Smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .
26598 | 0.61111 | Smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
26601 | 0.84722 | Smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
26603 | 0.73958 | Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
26606 | 0.79167 | So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
26608 | 0.66667 | So refreshingly incisive is Grant that for the first time he 'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the Hugh factor .
26609 | 0.73611 | So unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` Safe ! '
26613 | 0.79167 | Some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .
26620 | 0.75 | Sound the trumpets : For the first time since Desperately Seeking Susan , Madonna does n't suck as an actress .
26649 | 0.81944 | Still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .
26659 | 0.76389 | Sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both Caine and Fraser have their moments .
26664 | 0.72222 | Subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius .
26674 | 0.68056 | Superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .
26677 | 0.52778 | Sure , it 's more of the same , but as the film proves , that 's not always a bad thing .
26694 | 0.72222 | Tailored to entertain !
26703 | 0.90278 | Thanks to Scott 's charismatic Roger and Eisenberg 's sweet nephew , Roger Dodger is one of the most compelling variations on In the Company of Men .
26705 | 0.84722 | That rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .
26707 | 0.90278 | The 3D images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
26710 | 0.56944 | The AM-radio soundtrack and game cast -- Tierney and the inimitable Walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
26712 | 0.79167 | The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .
26738 | 0.84722 | The Powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question .
26749 | 0.86111 | The WWII drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear .
26753 | 0.90278 | The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales .
26754 | 0.91667 | The acting alone is worth the price of admission .
26757 | 0.55556 | The actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .
26766 | 0.83333 | The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams .
26768 | 0.73611 | The best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other Dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
26771 | 0.76389 | The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .
26773 | 0.94444 | The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .
26775 | 0.88889 | The comic performances are all spot on , especially Lee Ross 's turn as Ken .
26778 | 0.77778 | The continued good chemistry between Carmen and Juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
26780 | 0.55556 | The crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us .
26782 | 0.55556 | The disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on .
